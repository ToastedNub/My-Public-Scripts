 - Runs faster
 - Optimized for low end systems (you do have to mess with the scripts to make them stable on lower end systems)
 - Added workers (you can work on multiple frames at once)
 - Uses both CPU and GPU now, instead of just the GPU
 - Easier to understand ESRGAN layout (its already set up, you just have to run the build file)
 - Image, Gif, and Video support, instead of just images
 - Various optimizations
